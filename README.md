<center><h1> Almotabari3 Website </h1></center>
<hr />

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site is a national digital platform, and it's one of my first projects that I created using native PHP from scratch, along with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I always enjoy revisiting it to see how much progress I've made on my programming journey. The website mainly aims to facilitate and speed up the acquaintance process between the needy and the donor, in addition to spreading and encouraging the culture of blood donation and introducing nearby blood transfusion centers...etc.</div>
